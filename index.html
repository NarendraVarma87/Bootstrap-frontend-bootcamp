                                Actully Yes, but it's recommended to learn any one database either sql or no-sql also make sure to learn any one backend technology nodeJS is recommended you can also go with other options like springboot, php, python etc,.

                                First you need to learn any one, ReactJS is recommended then you need to explore other frameworks to based on your requirement also it's better to have good understading on advanced trends and librarys like for frontend there are some JS librarys eg Redux Axios Vite etc,. These will be an addon to your profile.

                                Ofcourse these are the basic things you need to know before you going to assume yourself as an developer but unfortunately only these are not sufficient now you need to learn css framework like Tailwind or bootstrap to make the design easy. And JS frameworks to make development easy.

                                For beginners JavaScript is easy to learn but comming to the performance TypeScript is great because TypeScript is more readable and maintainable than JavaScript. TypeScript supports abstraction through interfaces, while JavaScript does not. TypeScript allows developers to annotate code with decorators, while JavaScript does not.

                            Documentation is one of the most important resource a developer can have. When a new technology, framework or library is designed, the developers make a documentation explaining how to use that technology.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Whichever way you prefer to learn a new technology, whether by watching tutorials, reading a book or having someone teach you always take time to go through the official documentation. Take an example like learning React, after learning react hooks by watching tutorial or otherwise, refer to the section o the official documentation about hooks. Take time and go through, chances are you'll find something new or get a clearer explanation on something you didn't quite get which will save you hours of debugging.

                    Online courses teach students how to manage their time better since the student bears the responsibility of engaging with the course instead of simply showing up to class on an assigned day and time. As a result, students not only gain knowledge from the coursework, but they also sharpen their time management skills.

                    Learners gain a broader, global perspective through online learning. As we learn online, they are not limited to the resources and perspectives of their company or country. They can access online courses and materials from around the world, giving them a broader perspective on the world and their place in it. This can be especially beneficial for students who are dreaming to working in global companies or looking to expand their knowledge.
